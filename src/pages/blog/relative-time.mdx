# Localized Relative Time

When displaying dates in an app, it can be helpful to show them relative to the current time. For example, instead of showing the exact date and time a post was created, you could display it as "2 minutes ago" or "3 days ago." To achieve this, you can use the [Day.js](https://day.js.org/) library in combination with the [Number.prototype.toLocaleString()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/toLocaleString) method. This allows you to display localized relative time in a user-friendly and easily understandable format.

For instance, let's say your data has a `createdAt` property that represents the date and time when the data was created. Instead of displaying this value as an exact date and time, you can use Day.js and `toLocaleString()` to display it as a relative time, such as `2m` to signify that the data was created 2 minutes ago. This makes it easier for users to quickly understand how recent or old the data is.

## Day.js

Day.js is a minimalist JavaScript library that parses, validates, manipulates, and displays dates and times for modern browsers with a largely Moment.js-compatible API. It has a `fromNow` method that returns a string representing the relative time from now. For example, if you have a date object representing a time 2 minutes in the past, calling the `fromNow` method on that date object would return the string "2m".

```js
dayjs("1999-01-01").fromNow(true); // 22 years
```

One of the powerful features of Day.js is its ability to let you customize the way relative time is displayed. You can do this by providing your own `thresholds` configuration, which defines when a unit of time is considered a second, a minute, an hour, and so on.

```js
import dayjs from "dayjs";
import relativeTime from "dayjs/plugin/relativeTime";

dayjs.extend(relativeTime, {
  rounding: Math.floor,
  thresholds: [
    { l: "s", r: 1 },
    { l: "ss", r: 59, d: "second" },
    { l: "m", r: 1 },
    { l: "mm", r: 59, d: "minute" },
    { l: "h", r: 1 },
    { l: "hh", r: 23, d: "hour" },
    { l: "d", r: 1 },
    { l: "dd", r: 29, d: "day" },
    { l: "M", r: 1 },
    { l: "MM", r: 11, d: "month" },
    { l: "y", r: 1 },
    { l: "yy", d: "year" },
  ],
});
```

Each object in the thresholds array has three properties: `l`, `r`, and an optional `d`. The `l` property stands for "left" and represents the unit of time being considered. The `r` property stands for "right" and represents the threshold value for that unit of time. The `d` property stands for "display" and represents the display string for that unit of time.

For example, `{ l: "s", r: 1 }` means if the difference between two dates is less than or equal to 1 second, then it will be displayed as "1s". `{ l: "ss", r: 59, d: "second" }`means if the difference between two dates is greater than 1 second but less than or equal to 59 seconds, then it will be displayed as "Xs", where X is the number of seconds between the two dates.

## Localization

To display numbers in a format that is easily understandable by users, we can use the `toLocaleString()` method. This method returns a string representing a number in the user's default language settings.

```js
const n = 2;

n.toLocaleString(undefined, { style: "unit", unit: "minute", unitDisplay: "narrow" }); //2m (in en-US)
n.toLocaleString(undefined, { style: "unit", unit: "minute", unitDisplay: "short" }); //2 min (in en-US)
n.toLocaleString(undefined, { style: "unit", unit: "minute", unitDisplay: "long" }); //2 minutes (in en-US)
```

In addition to customizing the `thresholds` for relative time display, Day.js also allows you to configure the actual string that is returned by the `fromNow` method. This gives you even more control over how relative time is displayed to users.

```ts
import updateLocale from "dayjs/plugin/updateLocale";

type TimeUnit = "second" | "minute" | "hour" | "day" | "month" | "year";
type TimeUnitDisplay = "narrow" | "short" | "long";
export const localizeTimeWrapper =
  (unit: TimeUnit, unitDisplay: TimeUnitDisplay = "narrow") =>
  (n: number) =>
    n.toLocaleString(undefined, { style: "unit", unit, unitDisplay });

dayjs.extend(updateLocale);
dayjs.updateLocale(dayjs.locale(), {
  relativeTime: {
    s: localizeTimeWrapper("second"),
    ss: localizeTimeWrapper("second"),
    m: localizeTimeWrapper("minute"),
    mm: localizeTimeWrapper("minute"),
    h: localizeTimeWrapper("hour"),
    hh: localizeTimeWrapper("hour"),
    d: localizeTimeWrapper("day"),
    dd: localizeTimeWrapper("day"),
    M: localizeTimeWrapper("month", "short"),
    MM: localizeTimeWrapper("month", "short"),
    y: localizeTimeWrapper("year"),
    yy: localizeTimeWrapper("year"),
  },
});
```

To display localized relative time, we can define a function for each threshold object that we defined earlier. This function will accept a number as an argument and return a localized string representing that number along with its corresponding time unit.

## Interval Updates

To keep the relative time display up-to-date on the frontend, we can use the `setInterval` function to periodically call the `fromNow` method. For example, we could set an interval to call the `fromNow` method every second. This would update the relative time display every second, ensuring that it always shows the most accurate and up-to-date information. By using `setInterval` in this way, we can easily keep the relative time display current and accurate.
